    Oh Lord You've searched me,        You know my way;

  At the cross I bow my knee,
                                      G/B       C
Where Your blood was shed for me,
                                               D
There's no greater love than this.
A                       AG##/F      F#m
  You have overcome the grave,
                               G/B      C
Your glory fills the highest place,
                                        D
What can separate me now?

Verse 2:
G/B     C2   D    Em7                      G/B     C2           D
    You go before me,                           You shield my way,
G/B      C2     D    Em7                        C2             Dsus4  D
    Your hand upholds me;                    I know You love me.

E/G#    A2       B     C#m7               E/G#      A2       B   -
    And when the earth fades,               Falls from my eyes,
G/B         C2      D   Em7                  C2         Dsus4  D
    And You stand before me,               I know You love me;
C2         Dsus4  D
I know You love me.

Bridge:
                     C2    D              Em7                                   C        Em7    D
You tore the veil, You made a way                When You said that it is done.
