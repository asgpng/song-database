Intro:  E  Bm  A

Verse:
E        Bm       A	    E
I know a place, a wonderful place
		        Bm
Where accused and condemned
	  A     E
Find mercy and grace
                           Bm
Where the wrongs we have done
	     A         E
And the wrongs done to us 
                        Bm
Were nailed there with him
 A             E
There on the cross

Chorus 1:
       D                        A
At the cross,           (at the cross)
   Gmaj7         E
He died for our sin
       D                        A
At the cross,           (at the cross)
    Gmaj7	    E
He gave us life again

Chorus 2:
       D                        A
At the cross,           (at the cross)
   Gmaj7         E
You died for our sin
       D                        A
At the cross,           (at the cross)
    Gmaj7	    E
You gave us life again
