This is my prayer in the desert, when all that’s within me feels dry
Bm             A                  G                               Bm            A                G

And this is my prayer in the fire, in weakness or trial or pain

There is a faith proved of more worth than gold, so refine me Lord through the flame

I will bring praise, I will bring praise,
                   G                                    D
No weapon formed against me shall remain

I will rejoice, I will declare
                   G                A      Bm  A  G       Bm  A  G (hold Bm into bridge)
God is my victory and He is here

This is my prayer in the battle, when triumph is still on its way

I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ, so firm on His promise I’ll stand

D                                               Bm
All of my life, in every season, You are still God
                              A       G                            D
I have a reason to sing, I have a reason to worship

Verse 4:
Bm            A                   G                   Bm              A             G
This is my prayer in the harvest, when favor and providence flow
Bm              A               G                          Bm              A                 G
I know I’m filled to be emptied again, the seed I’ve received I will sow
