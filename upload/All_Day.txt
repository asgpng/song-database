Verse 1:
I don’t care what they say about me
It’s alright, It’s alright
I don’t care what they think about me
It’s alright, they’ll get it one day

Pre-Chorus:
I love you, I’ll follow you
You are my, my life
I will read my Bible and pray
I will follow you all day

Verse 2:
I don’t care what it costs anymore
‘Cause you gave it all and I’m following you
I don’t care what it takes anymore
No matter what happens I’m going your way

Chorus:
