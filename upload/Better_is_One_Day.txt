For here my heart is satisfied

Within your presence

I sing beneath the shadow of your wings

Better is one day in your courts   better is one day in house

One thing I ask and I would seek

To see your beauty

To find you in the place your glory dwells

For you the living God

Your spirit's water to my soul
