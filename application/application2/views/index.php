12/Spring 13 </h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The deadline for Independent Work Sign-up for Spring 2013 is
January 11, 2013.
 </b>Hard copies of your IW/thesis
    <a href="Forms/IWSignupFormAug2012.pdf">signup forms</a><a> are
    due then, signed by your faculty advisor, in the UGC's office. If
    you do not have an advisor at that time, you may be assigned a
    faculty member randomly.</a></td>

<p><b>Any forms you need can be obtained from the Undergrad
Coordinator (UGC), Colleen Kenny-McGinley in room CS 210, if you cannot print
them off the web. Most forms must be signed by your advisor
before they are submitted.  The deadlines are for turning in the
forms.  <font color="#FF0000"><i>It is your responsibility to meet
with your advisor prior to every deadline to have them read the
appropriate reports, help you with presentations and written work,
and/or sign the appropriate forms</i>.</font> Excuses such as &quot;my
advisor was out of town last week&quot; will not be accepted.  Be
organized and plan ahead.  Use fax machines, scanners and modern
technology such as email to coordinate with your advisor.</b></p>

<p>
All
deadlines are firm.&nbsp; If you miss any deadlines (including
deadlines to sign up for presentation slots) your final grade will be
penalized.</b></p>


<p>Most of the dates below apply to both the single-semester IW projects
as well as the 2-semester thesis and IW projects. Unless otherwise
indicated, assume that the deadline specified applies to you.
